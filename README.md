# ✨ About Me
Hi! I'm a **Software Developer** who loves turning complex problems into clean, functional code. I enjoy building things from the ground up, whether it's a sleek website or a smart backend system.
My main tools are **Python** and **Java**, and I'm very comfortable working with **Flask** and **HTML** to bring ideas to life. Lately, I've been diving deep into **Machine Learning**. I’m really interested in how we can use data and predictive models to make software smarter and more helpful.
I’m always looking to learn new things and find creative ways to blend traditional coding with AI! 🌸
